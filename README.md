### Hello adventurer!

Sadly, this is not the town of Honeywood, but since you are here, enjoy this image with high shamanistic quality:

I've grown tired of being fed with visual poison on mainstream social networks, so I've decided to run my own.  
https://www.lancraft.cz/

About 10 000 poor souls decided to join, for some unknown reason. Now instead of getting away with fast-food quality code and sql queries I have to spend most of my time optimizing, so we can continue sending emojis and nudes each to other. The worst part is that everytime a hot girl is about to send me such a perfect pic, she somehow missclicks and I receive a bug report instead. It's annoying but I give them the benefit of the doubt.

Generally I use M$ technologies and I love them. But everytime I start to like the company too much, they are swift to slap me in the face with _This repository is now Archived_ or _It looks like your Sql Server is outdated, would you like to sell your other kidney and upgrade?_

Writing compilers by night is an endless source of pleasure for me. Sadly, that cannot be said about the end users of them. I like to lure them with innocent _Look the syntax is so simple, you can do it_ and then leave them to fight inner demons of the documentation. 

By day I work as a software engineer. Now for https://www.scio.cz/.  
_All opinions are my own._  

Once I've sumbited a PR which makes one argument in some NHibernate function optional. Now I can claim I'm a contributor of my favourite ORM.  

I used to tinker around with Game Maker (6, 8, gay maker virus - fu** time to reinstall Windows, Studio, Studio 2 beta, lost track of it). I didn't like the black box so I've attempted to reimplement the engine using MonoGame. It almost works. It actually works (for a while) if you know what you are doing. It also leaks a lot of memory.

On lonely nights I used to play CS:GO with my friends until I've decided that Gold Nova 1 is definitely not the right rank for me, pasted all the public snipets from UnknownCheats to my fork of Osiris and submited iconic PR#2074 which is well known in cheaters community now. With naive bruteforcing it can outplay almost any russian potato computer in public matchmaking. Now I have no friends willing to play with me. Fun fact: I've played on my main account with a simple external private I've coded for 200+ hours and I'm still not banned. One famous Polish YouTuber wasted willingly his time and shot an interview with me about the cheat.

Real legends I wish to be like when I grow up:  
https://bellard.org/ (this guy is definitely an alien)  
https://twitter.com/id_aa_carmack (almost invented 0x5F3759DF)  
https://templeos.org/ (we report to him, he reports to God)  
https://twitter.com/brutaldoomguy (cyka blyat, he still makes DOOM great again)  

Apart from coding I play on a guitar. Started to learn it as a way to _link_ girls a few years ago, then realized that reverse polish notation doesn't need parentheses and I can evaluate 1 + 1 using a stack. At that moment I've stopped my Tinder Gold subscription and happily coded ever since.
