### Hello adventurer!

Sadly, this is not the town of Honeywood, but since you are here, enjoy this image with high shamanistic quality:

I've grown tired of being fed with visual poison on mainstream social networks, so I've decided to run my own.  
https://www.lancraft.cz/

About 10 000 poor souls decided to join, for some unknown reason. Now instead of getting away with fast-food quality code and sql queries I have to spend most of my time optimizing, so we can continue sending emojis and nudes each to other. The worst part is that everytime a hot girl is about to send me such a perfect pic, she somehow missclicks and I receive a bug report instead. It's annoying but I give them the benefit of the doubt.

Generally I use M$ technologies and I love them. But everytime I start to like the company too much, they are swift to slap me in the face with _This repository is now Archived (flashbacks from ~~Vietnam~~, Silverlight, ASP MVC)_ or _It looks like your Sql Server is outdated, would you like to sell your other kidney and upgrade?_

Writing compilers by night is an endless source of pleasure for me. Sadly, that cannot be said about the end users of them. I like to lure them with innocent _Look the syntax is so simple, you can do it_ and then leave them to fight inner demons of the documentation. 

By day I work as a software engineer. Now for https://www.scio.cz/.  
_All opinions are my own._  

Once I've sumbited a PR which makes one argument in some NHibernate function optional. They merged it. Now I can claim I'm a contributor of my favourite ORM.  

I used to tinker around with Game Maker (6, 8, gay maker virus - time to reinstall Windows, Studio, Studio 2 beta, lost track of it). I didn't like the black box so I've attempted to reimplement the engine using MonoGame. It almost works. It actually works (for a while) if you know what you are doing. It also leaks a lot of memory.

My favourite game engine now is Libre Office - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L56azbL3DjA&ab_channel=quwex  
  
On lonely nights I used to play CS:GO with my friends until I've decided that Gold Nova 1 is definitely not the right rank for me, pasted all the public snipets from UnknownCheats to my fork of Osiris and submited iconic PR#2074 which is well known in cheaters community now. With naive bruteforcing it can outplay almost any russian potato computer in public matchmaking. Now I have no friends willing to play with me. Fun fact: I've played on my main account with a simple external private I've coded for 200+ hours and I'm still not banned. One famous Polish YouTuber wasted willingly his time and shot an interview with me about the cheat.

Real legends I wish to be like when I grow up:

Apart from coding I play on a guitar. Started to learn it as a way to _link_ girls a few years ago, then realized that reverse polish notation doesn't need parentheses and I can evaluate 1 + 1 using a stack. At that moment I've stopped my Tinder Gold subscription and happily coded ever since.

Once in a while I have to initiate not-yet-burnt-out youth souls to the miracles of programming. On such an occasion I'm often asked whether the slides could be presented in Powerpoint. To that I always reply that we already have Powerpoint at home.

_About thread starvation and how everytime you write a sync IO method a kitten dies_

Here are some easy tricks to ensure your alpha-programmer dominance and become leader of the pack:
- use `xor eax, eax` instead of `mov eax, 0`.
- use `-~n` instead of `n + 1`.
- use `n << 2` instead of `n * 2`.
- always question time complexity.
- if that doesn't work question space complexity.
- as a last resort you can always say that you would burn 3 MD on this algorithm but if they want it, you'll do it.
- rather suffer with old C than do the same thing quickly in Pascal. [Real programmers don't use Pascal.](https://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/real.programmers.html)
- real programmers don't use current summer meta JavaScript framework either.
   
As of 2021 I literally want only one thing and guys at JetBrains think it's fucking disgusting.
